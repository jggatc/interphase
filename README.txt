Interphase - Pygame Interface Module

The module adds interface panel functionality to a Pygame application. It was developed as a simple GUI with the goal to simulate a digital display panel. The module provides interface and control objects to design a panel, with methods to manage the panel from the application code. Run run_demo.py for an interface panel demo that is coded in tests/demo.py. The module requires Python 2+ (https://www.python.org/) and Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/). Interphase module is also functional with PyJ2D (https://gatc.ca/projects/pyj2d/) and Pyjsdl (https://gatc.ca/projects/pyjsdl/). Information concerning use of the Interphase module is included in docs/guide.txt.
